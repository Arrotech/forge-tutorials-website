# Contributing Guidelines

Here's a couple of guidelines and recommendations for content authors
to ensure consistency.

## Code

- Try and structure the tutorials so that the code can be run and tested
throughout the development, not just at the end

- Use the line highlighting feature in code snippets that's provided by Docusaurus
to show code that should be added

## Imagery

- When inserting screenshots of an entire window, let's say a browser window,
or a Visual Studio code window, use some predefined size (TBD), and if possible,
use the shadow effect that's generated by macOS when you take a screenshot
of a window with `Shift` + `Cmd` + `4`.

- The final image should have the maximum width of 1500 pixels.

- Consider converting images to WebP, for example, using the [cwebp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/cwebp)
utility.
