Once the project is ready, create a couple of subfolders in your project folder that we're going to need later:

- `Controllers` - this is where we're going to implement all the server endpoints
- `Models` - here we're going to keep all the server-side logic that can be shared by different endpoints
- `wwwrooot` - this is where we're going to put all the client side assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.)
