# Application Setup

In this step we're going to create a new Node.js project, install all the required dependencies,
and setup a basic [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) server.

## Create project

Create a new folder for your project, navigate to it in the command line, and initialize a new
Node.js project:

```bash
npm init -y
```

Next, install all the Node.js dependencies we're going to use. In this case it will be
the [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) framework, an Express.js [middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html)
for handling `multipart/form-data` requests, and finally the [Forge SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forge-apis):

```bash
npm install --save express express-formidable forge-apis
```

The `"dependencies"` in your `package.json` file should now look something like this (potentially
with slightly different version numbers):

```json
// ...
"dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "express-formidable": "^1.2.0",
    "forge-apis": "^0.8.6"
}
// ...
```

Finally, let's create a couple more subfolders in the project folder that we're going to need later:

- `wwwroot` - this is where we're going to put all the client side assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.)
- `routes` - this is where we're going to implement all the server endpoints
- `services` - here we're going to keep all the server-side logic that can be shared by different endpoints

## Application config

Our Node.js application will need a couple of configuration parameters to run properly, for example,
the credentials of our Forge app (client ID and secret) for communicating with Autodesk Forge services,
and the name of a bucket in the [Data Management](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/developers_guide/overview)
service for storing designs. We will pass these parameters to our app using environment variables.

Create a `config.js` file in the root of your project folder, and add the following code:

```js title="config.js"
let { FORGE_CLIENT_ID, FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET, FORGE_BUCKET, PORT } = process.env;
if (!FORGE_CLIENT_ID || !FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET) {
    console.warn('Missing some of the environment variables.');
    process.exit(1);
}
FORGE_BUCKET = FORGE_BUCKET || `${FORGE_CLIENT_ID.toLowerCase()}-basic-app`;
PORT = PORT || 8080;

module.exports = {
    FORGE_CLIENT_ID,
    FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET,
    FORGE_BUCKET,
    PORT
};
```

We simply read the environment variables from `process.env`, and exit the application
immediately if any of the required properties are missing. And if no bucket name is provided,
we generate one by appending the `-basic-app` suffix to the Forge Client ID.

:::caution
Note that the Data Management service requires bucket names to be **globally unique**,
and attempts to create a bucket with an already used name will fail with `409 Conflict`.
See the [documentation](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/buckets-POST)
for more details.
:::

## Create basic server

Create a `server.js` file in the root of your project folder with the following code:

```js title="server.js"
const express = require('express');
const { PORT } = require('./config.js');

let app = express();
app.use(express.static('wwwroot'));
app.listen(PORT, function () { console.log(`Server listening on port ${PORT}...`); });
```

For now the server isn't doing much, just serving static assets from the `public` subfolder
(which is currently empty), and reporting all errors to the console and back to the client.

Next, let's add a `"start": "node server.js"` script to the `package.json` file so that we can
easily run our application later:

```json
// ...
"scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js"
}
// ...
```

## Try it out

In order to run and debug our application in Visual Studio Code, we need to create
a [launch configuration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations).
Create a new `.vscode` folder in your project folder, and create a `launch.json` file inside this
folder with the following content:

```json title=".vscode/launch.json"
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Launch Server",
            "runtimeExecutable": "npm",
            "runtimeArgs": [
                "start"
            ],
            "envFile": "${workspaceFolder}/.env",
            "skipFiles": [
                "<node_internals>/**/*.js"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

The JSON structure defines a single launch configuration called _Launch Server_
that will start our application using the `npm start` command, and what is more
important, it will look for a `.env` file in the project folder, and provide
any `<key>="<value>"` pairs defined in this file as environment variables to our application.
Let's create the `.env` file in the project folder, and populate it with our environment
variables:

``` title=".env"
FORGE_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"
FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
FORGE_BUCKET="optional-name-of-existing-bucket"
```

:::caution
Since the `.env` file contains sensitive information, make sure that it is **excluded** from git.
This can be done by adding the `.env` line to the `.gitignore` file.
:::

Now start the application from Visual Studio Code (for example, via the _Run > Start Debugging_
menu, or by pressing `F5`), and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
in the browser. The server should respond with `Cannot GET /` because we haven't added any
logic to it just yet. That's going to be the topic of the next step.
