Now that we have a basic ASP.NET application setup, let's try it out!

With your new launch settings, you can now start the application (for example, using
the _Debug_ > _Start Debugging_ menu item, or by pressing `F5`). Visual Studio will automatically
open the [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) URL in your browser. You should get
a 404 response because we haven't implemented any server logic yet. That's going to be the goal
of the next step.

:::info
When starting the application for the first time you may be prompted to trust the self-signed
SSL certificate generated by ASP.NET Core. This is expected, and you can accept this prompt.
