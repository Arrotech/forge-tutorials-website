When the `dotnet` utility bootstrapped your application, it generated random port numbers
for its HTTP and HTTPS addresses. Let's change those to a specific port number (8080)
that we will use throughout this tutorial.

Open the `launchSettings.json` file under the `Properties` folder, and set the `applicationUrl`
property to `http://localhost:8080`.
