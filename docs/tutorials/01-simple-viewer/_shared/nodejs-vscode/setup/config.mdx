Our Node.js application will need a couple of configuration parameters to run properly, for example,
the credentials of our Forge app (client ID and secret) for communicating with Autodesk Forge services,
and the name of a bucket in the [Data Management](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/developers_guide/overview)
service for storing designs. We will pass these parameters to our app using environment variables.

Create a `config.js` file in the root of your project folder, and add the following code:

```js title="config.js"
let { FORGE_CLIENT_ID, FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET, FORGE_BUCKET, PORT } = process.env;
if (!FORGE_CLIENT_ID || !FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET) {
    console.warn('Missing some of the environment variables.');
    process.exit(1);
}
FORGE_BUCKET = FORGE_BUCKET || `${FORGE_CLIENT_ID.toLowerCase()}-basic-app`;
PORT = PORT || 8080;

module.exports = {
    FORGE_CLIENT_ID,
    FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET,
    FORGE_BUCKET,
    PORT
};
```

We simply read the environment variables from `process.env`, and exit the application
immediately if any of the required properties are missing. And if no bucket name is provided,
we generate one by appending the `-basic-app` suffix to the Forge Client ID.

:::caution
Note that the Data Management service requires bucket names to be **globally unique**,
and attempts to create a bucket with an already used name will fail with `409 Conflict`.
See the [documentation](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/buckets-POST)
for more details.
