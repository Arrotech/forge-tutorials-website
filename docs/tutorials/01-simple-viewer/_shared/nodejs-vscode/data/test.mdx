Time to try our improved server application. Start (or restart) the app from Visual Studio Code
as usual, and navigate to [http://localhost:8080/api/models](http://localhost:8080/api/models)
in the browser. The server should respond with a JSON list with names and URNs of all objects
available in your configured bucket. If you are just getting started, you may get a JSON response
with an empty array (`[]`) which is expected. In the screenshot below we can already see a couple
of files that were uploaded to our bucket in the past.
