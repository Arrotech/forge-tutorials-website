## Viewer logic

<p>
    Let's start by implementing the Forge Viewer functionality of our application. Create
    a <code>viewer.js</code> file under the <code>{props.assetsFolder}</code> subfolder
    with the following code:
</p>

<CodeBlock title={props.assetsFolder + '/viewer.js'} className="language-js">{ViewerJsSource}</CodeBlock>

The script is an [ES6 module](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)
that exports two functions, `initViewer` that will create a new instance of Forge Viewer
in the specified DOM container, and `loadModel` which will load a specific model to the viewer.

## Application logic

<p>
    Next, let's define the logic of the application itself. We will need to populate
    the UI with all models available for viewing, and also the UI for uploading and
    translating new models. Create a <code>main.js</code> file under
    the <code>{props.assetsFolder}</code> subfolder with the following content:
</p>

<CodeBlock title={props.assetsFolder + '/main.js'} className="language-js">{MainJsSource}</CodeBlock>

The scripts will initialize the viewer, populate a dropdown element in the UI with models
retrieved from the `/api/models` endpoint, and setup the file upload UI. Note that when
the uploaded file has a `.zip` extension, the JavaScript logic will also prompt the user
for the name of the file **inside the archive** that should be converted by Forge.

## User interface

And finally, let's build the UI of our application.

<p>
    Create a <code>main.css</code> file under the <code>{props.assetsFolder}</code> subfolder,
    and populate it with the following CSS rules:
</p>

<CodeBlock title={props.assetsFolder + '/main.css'} className="language-css">{MainCssSource}</CodeBlock>

<p>
    Then, create an <code>index.html</code> file (also in the <code>{props.assetsFolder}</code> subfolder)
    with the following content:
</p>

<CodeBlock title={props.assetsFolder + '/index.html'} className="language-html">{IndexHtmlSource}</CodeBlock>

The HTML markup simply uses a `<select>` element as the dropdown for listing the viewable models,
and an `<input type="file">` element with a `<button>` to handle the uploading of a new model.
Note that since `main.js` is also an ES6 module, we have to use `type="module"` in its `<script>` tag.

<p>
    The application will look for <code>favicon.ico</code> and <code>logo.png</code> images
    under the <code>{props.assetsFolder}</code> folder to use as the website's icon and logo.
