# Introduction

In this tutorial we're going to build a simple Forge application that will let us
upload, translate, and preview 3D designs and 2D drawings.

> TODO: screenshot or gif

We will use the following components of the platform:

- [Authentication service](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/developers_guide/overview)
- [Data Management service](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/developers_guide/overview)
- [Model Derivative service](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/model-derivative/v2/developers_guide/overview)
- [Forge Viewer](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/developers_guide/overview)

> IDEA: maybe replace the bullet list with a collection of official Forge icons

The full implementation of this sample is available on GitHub:

- https://github.com/petrbroz/forge-simple-viewer-nodejs
- https://github.com/petrbroz/forge-simple-viewer-dotnet

Get started by selecting the programming language of your choice:

- [Node.js](nodejs/server)
- [.NET](dotnet/server)
