# Dashboard

## Introduction

In this tutorial we will enhance the [Simple Viewer](../simple-viewer) application
with dashboard-like functionality, for example, retrieving and aggregating information
from our design metadata, displaying the results in charts and tables, and linking
the results back to the design elements in the 3D view.

:::info
All the functionality in this tutorial is implemented as viewer extensions, and will only use
the viewer UI, so you're free to use any Forge application you want as your starting point.
Note however that the names of folders, and the way you import JavaScript files into your
web application, might be a little bit different.

We will be using the [Viewer](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/developers_guide/overview)
API and its various features such as:

- Creating and loading viewer extensions
- Querying metadata of loaded models
- Controlling the state of the viewer
- Customizing the viewer toolbar
- Creating custom UI elements

:::tip
Complete implementation of this tutorial is available in the [dashboard](https://github.com/petrbroz/forge-simple-viewer-nodejs/tree/dashboards)
branch of https://github.com/petrbroz/forge-simple-viewer-nodejs.

Alright, let's get started!
