# Basic Extension

Forge Viewer provides its own set of [APIs](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Viewing/Viewer3D)
that you can use to customize its look and feel, behavior, and even the rendered content. While you _could_ just
start sprinkling your viewer customization code here and there, it is a good practice to encapsulate
custom viewer functionality into a _viewer extension_. That way you can easily share the same
functionality across different pages of your web application, and even across different projects entirely.

Let's start by implementing a simple viewer extension that will extract different types of information
from the currently loaded design. Later on we will implement additional extensions that will display this
information in different ways.

## Extension skeleton

Go to the folder that contains your client side assets such as the `index.html` page (in our case it's
the `wwwroot` folder), and create a new subfolder called `extensions`. This is where we will store all
our viewer extensions. Create a `summary.js` file in the `extensions` folder, and populate it with
the following content:

```js
class SummaryExtension extends Autodesk.Viewing.Extension {
    constructor(viewer, options) {
        super(viewer, options);
    }

    load() {
        console.log('SummaryExtension loaded.');
        return true;
    }

    unload() {
        console.log('SummaryExtension unloaded.');
        return true;
    }
}

Autodesk.Viewing.theExtensionManager.registerExtension('SummaryExtension', SummaryExtension);
```

As you can see, a viewer extension is basically a subclass of [Autodesk.Viewing.Extension](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Viewing/Extension)
that overrides some of its lifecycle methods. For now we have only overridden the following methods:

- `load` - called when the extension is loaded by the viewer, returning a boolean flag indicating whether the loading was successful
- `unload` - called when the extension is unloaded by the viewer, returning a boolean flag indicating whether the unloading was successful

We also **register** the extension under a specific unique ID so that the viewer can later find it. This is done via
a singleton object called `Autodesk.Viewing.theExtensionManager` and its `registerExtension(extensionId, extensionClass)`
method.

Now, let's make sure the script is loaded by our web application. In our case we can simply add the following
`import` statement to the top of the `wwwroot/viewer.js` file:

```js
import './extensions/summary.js';
```

:::info
If you're working with a different application source code, you may need to include the file
using a `<script>` tag in your `index.html` page, for example, like so:

```html
<script src="extensions/summary.js"></script>
```
:::

Finally, we need to tell the viewer to load this extension when it's initialized. We can do that
by passing the extension ID to the `Autodesk.Viewing.GuiViewer3D` constructor, like so:

```js
const config = {
    extensions: [
        'SummaryExtension',
    ]
};
const viewer = new Autodesk.Viewing.GuiViewer3D(container, config);
```

## Metadata

Now let's add some custom functionality to our extension. We will start with two helper methods,
one that will traverse the object hierarchy of a design and return all _leaf objects_ (that is,
objects that do not have any other children), and another one that will retrieve the names of all
properties found on all objects in the model. Add the following two methods to your
`SummaryExtension` class:

```js
class SummaryExtension extends Autodesk.Viewing.Extension {
    constructor(viewer, options) {
        super(viewer, options);
    }

    load() {
        console.log('SummaryExtension loaded.');
        return true;
    }

    unload() {
        console.log('SummaryExtension unloaded.');
        return true;
    }

    // highlight-start
    /**
     * Finds all leaf objects (that is, objects that do not have any children)
     * in the object hierarchy of a model.
     * @async
     * @param {Autodesk.Viewing.Model} model Forge model.
     * @returns {Promise<number[]>} IDs of all leaf objects.
     */
    findLeafNodes(model) {
        return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
            model.getObjectTree(function (tree) {
                let leaves = [];
                tree.enumNodeChildren(tree.getRootId(), function (dbid) {
                    if (tree.getChildCount(dbid) === 0) {
                        leaves.push(dbid);
                    }
                }, true);
                resolve(leaves);
            }, reject);
        });
    }
    // highlight-end

    // highlight-start
    /**
     * Finds names of all properties available in a model.
     * @async
     * @param {Autodesk.Viewing.Model} model Forge model.
     * @returns {Promise<string[]>} List of property names.
     */
    async findPropertyNames(model) {
        const dbids = await this.findLeafNodes(model);
        return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
            model.getBulkProperties(dbids, {}, function (results) {
                let propNames = new Set();
                for (const result of results) {
                    for (const prop of result.properties) {
                        propNames.add(prop.displayName);
                    }
                }
                resolve(Array.from(propNames.values()));
            }, reject);
        });
    }
    // highlight-end
}

Autodesk.Viewing.theExtensionManager.registerExtension('SummaryExtension', SummaryExtension);
```

Here we're already using some of the first viewer APIs such as:

- [Model#getObjectTree](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Viewing/Model/#getobjecttree-onsuccesscallback-onerrorcallback) - used to
retrieve the object hierarchy (sometimes called an "instance tree") of the model
- [Model#getBulkProperties](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Viewing/Model/#getbulkproperties-dbids-options-onsuccesscallback-onerrorcallback) - used to
retrieve the metadata for one or more objects
- [InstanceTree#getRootId](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Private/InstanceTree/#getrootid) - returning the ID of the root object
- [InstanceTree#enumNodeChildren](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Private/InstanceTree/#enumnodechildren-node-callback-recursive) - used to
enumerate (recursively) all children of a specific object

## Aggregation

Let's finalize our first extension by adding two more methods: one for finding all the values
that appear for a specific property (incl. the list of object IDs where this property value is found),
and another one for aggregating the values of a specific property across a list of objects.
Add the following methods to the `SummaryExtension` class:

```js
class SummaryExtension extends Autodesk.Viewing.Extension {
    constructor(viewer, options) {
        super(viewer, options);
    }

    load() {
        console.log('SummaryExtension loaded.');
        return true;
    }

    unload() {
        console.log('SummaryExtension unloaded.');
        return true;
    }

    /**
     * Finds all leaf objects (that is, objects that do not have any children)
     * in the object hierarchy of a model.
     * @async
     * @param {Autodesk.Viewing.Model} model Forge model.
     * @returns {Promise<number[]>} IDs of all leaf objects.
     */
    findLeafNodes(model) {
        return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
            model.getObjectTree(function (tree) {
                let leaves = [];
                tree.enumNodeChildren(tree.getRootId(), function (dbid) {
                    if (tree.getChildCount(dbid) === 0) {
                        leaves.push(dbid);
                    }
                }, true);
                resolve(leaves);
            }, reject);
        });
    }

    /**
     * Finds names of all properties available in a model.
     * @async
     * @param {Autodesk.Viewing.Model} model Forge model.
     * @returns {Promise<string[]>} List of property names.
     */
    async findPropertyNames(model) {
        const dbids = await this.findLeafNodes(model);
        return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
            model.getBulkProperties(dbids, {}, function (results) {
                let propNames = new Set();
                for (const result of results) {
                    for (const prop of result.properties) {
                        propNames.add(prop.displayName);
                    }
                }
                resolve(Array.from(propNames.values()));
            }, reject);
        });
    }

## Try it out

Alright, our first extension is now ready to use. It doesn't have any user interface but we can
test it out directly in the browser console. Start your application as usual, open it in the browser,
load one of your 3D models, and then run the following commands in the console:

```js
let summaryExt = NOP_VIEWER.getExtension('SummaryExtension');
summaryExt.findPropertyNames(NOP_VIEWER.model).then(console.log).catch(console.error);
```

:::info
All modern browsers provide _developer tools_, incl. a console, that you can use to debug
your web applications. Look for the instructions for the specific browser of your choice
on how these tools can be accessed.
:::

:::warning
`NOP_VIEWER` is a reference to the current instance of `Autodesk.Viewing.Viewer3D` that you
can use to quickly debug or experiment with the viewer APIs in the browser console, but
we do not recommend using it in production code!
:::

Since we have already configured the viewer to load our `SummaryExtension` during its
initialization, we can simply retrieve the extension object using the viewer's
`getExtension` method. The `findPropertyNames` method on our extension returns a promise,
so we simply chain the output to either `console.log` (if the promise is fulfilled)
or `console.error` (if the promise is rejected). You will receive different results
depending on the type of model you have loaded in the viewer. In our case it was a Revit
model, and the extension returned the following data:
