# Viewer & UI

import ViewerPartial from '../_viewer.mdx';

Finally, we're ready to build the client-side piece of our application.

<ViewerPartial assetsFolder="wwwroot" />

## Try it out

And that's it! Your application is now ready for action. Start it from Visual Studio, and when
you go to [https://localhost:7197](https://localhost:7197), you should be presented with a simple UI,
with a tree-view on the left side, and an empty viewer on the right. Try browsing through the tree,
and select a specific version of one of your files. After that the corresponding model should be loaded
into the viewer.
