# Introduction

In this tutorial we're going to build a Forge application that will let us
browse through our designs in 3rd party applications built on top of the platform
such as BIM 360 Docs or ACC.

![Preview](./preview.gif)

We will use the following components of the platform:

- [Authentication service](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/developers_guide/overview)
- [Data Management service](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/developers_guide/overview)
- [Forge Viewer](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/developers_guide/overview)

> IDEA: maybe replace the bullet list with a collection of official Forge icons

The full implementation of this sample is available on GitHub:

- https://github.com/petrbroz/forge-hubs-browser-nodejs
- https://github.com/petrbroz/forge-hubs-browser-dotnet

Get started by selecting the programming language of your choice:

- [Node.js](nodejs-vscode/server)
- [.NET](dotnet-vscode/server)
