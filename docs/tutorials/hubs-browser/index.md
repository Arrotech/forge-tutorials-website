# Introduction

In this tutorial we're going to build a Forge application that will let us
browse through our designs in 3rd party applications built on top of the platform
such as BIM 360 Docs or ACC.

We will use the following components of the platform:

- [Authentication service](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/developers_guide/overview)
- [Data Management service](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/developers_guide/overview)
- [Forge Viewer](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/developers_guide/overview)
