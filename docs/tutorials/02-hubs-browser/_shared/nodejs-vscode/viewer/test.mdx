And that's it! Your application is now complete. Start (or restart) the app from Visual Studio Code as usual,
and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser. You should be presented with
a simple UI, with a tree view on the left side, and an empty viewer on the right. Try browsing through the tree,
and select a specific version of one of your files. After that the corresponding model should be loaded into the viewer.
