In order to run and debug our application in Visual Studio Code, we need to create
a [launch configuration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations).
Create a new `.vscode` folder in your project folder, and create a `launch.json` file inside this
folder with the following content:

```json title=".vscode/launch.json"
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Launch Server",
            "runtimeExecutable": "npm",
            "runtimeArgs": [
                "start"
            ],
            "envFile": "${workspaceFolder}/.env",
            "skipFiles": [
                "<node_internals>/**/*.js"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

The JSON structure defines a single launch configuration called _Launch Server_
that will start our application using the `npm start` command, and what is more
important, it will look for a `.env` file in the project folder, and provide
any `<key>="<value>"` pairs defined in this file as environment variables to our application.
Let's create the `.env` file in the project folder, and populate it with our environment
variables:

``` title=".env"
FORGE_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"
FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
FORGE_CALLBACK_URL="http://localhost:8080/api/auth/callback"
SERVER_SESSION_SECRET="some-random-phrase"
```

:::caution
Since the `.env` file contains sensitive information, make sure that it is **excluded** from git.
This can be done by adding the `.env` line to the `.gitignore` file.
:::

Now start the application from Visual Studio Code (for example, via the _Run > Start Debugging_
menu, or by pressing `F5`), and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
in the browser. The server should respond with `Cannot GET /` because we haven't added any
logic to it just yet. That's going to be the topic of the next step.
