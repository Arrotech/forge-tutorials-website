Our Node.js application will need a couple of configuration parameters to run properly, for example,
the credentials of our Forge app for communicating with Autodesk Forge services, or the callback URL
where our users will be redirected to during the [3-legged authentication workflow](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/tutorials/get-3-legged-token/).
We will pass these parameters to the server app using environment variables.

Create a `config.js` file in the root of your project folder, and add the following code:

```js title="config.js"
let { FORGE_CLIENT_ID, FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET, FORGE_CALLBACK_URL, SERVER_SESSION_SECRET, PORT } = process.env;
if (!FORGE_CLIENT_ID || !FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET || !FORGE_CALLBACK_URL || !SERVER_SESSION_SECRET) {
    console.warn('Missing some of the environment variables.');
    process.exit(1);
}
const INTERNAL_TOKEN_SCOPES = ['data:read'];
const PUBLIC_TOKEN_SCOPES = ['viewables:read'];
PORT = PORT || 8080;

module.exports = {
    FORGE_CLIENT_ID,
    FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET,
    FORGE_CALLBACK_URL,
    SERVER_SESSION_SECRET,
    INTERNAL_TOKEN_SCOPES,
    PUBLIC_TOKEN_SCOPES,
    PORT
};
```

We simply read the environment variables from `process.env`, and exit the application
immediately if any of the required properties are missing.
