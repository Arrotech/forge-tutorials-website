Let's see if our new server endpoint works. Start the application, and when Visual Studio
opens the browser for you, navigate to [http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login](http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login).
You should be redirected to Autodesk login page, and after logging in, you should
be redirected back to your application, for now simply returning 404. This is expected as we haven't
implemented the `GET /` endpoint yet. However, if you try and explore the cookies stored
by your browser for the `localhost` origin, you'll notice that the application is already storing
the authentication data.
