And that's it for the server side. Time to try it out! Start the application as usual.
You should now be able to explore the new endpoints tha will eventually be used from
the UI. For example, if you go to [http://localhost:8080/api/hubs](http://localhost:8080/api/hubs),
the server should respond with a JSON list of all the hubs you have access to. Try copying the ID of
one of the hubs, and use it in another URL: http://localhost:8080/api/hubs/{your-hub-id}/projects.
In this case the server application should respond with a JSON list of all projects
available under the specified hub.
