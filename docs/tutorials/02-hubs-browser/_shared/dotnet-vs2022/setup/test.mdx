Now that we have a basic ASP.NET application setup, let's try it out!

In order to be able to run our app, we need to provide a "launch configuration" for it,
specifying things such as the environment variables, and the address and port the server should
be listening on. Open the `launchSettings.json` file in the `Properties` folder, add the
`FORGE_CLIENT_ID`, `FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `FORGE_CALLBACK_URL` environment variables
with your Forge app credentials and callback, and set the `applicationUrl`
to `http://localhost:8080`.

:::caution
The callback URL we specify here must match the callback URL that you've configured
for your Forge application on https://forge.autodesk.com/myapps.
:::

When you start the application, Visual Studio will automaticaly open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
in your browser, and you should get a 404 response because we haven't implemented any server logic yet.
That's going to be the topic of the next step.

:::info
When starting the application for the first time you may be prompted to trust the self-signed
SSL certificate generated by ASP.NET Core. This is expected, and you can accept this prompt.
