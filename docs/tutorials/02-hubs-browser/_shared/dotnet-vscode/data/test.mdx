And that's it for the server side. Time to try it out! Make sure you set all
the required environment variables, and run the application:

```bash
export FORGE_CLIENT_ID=your-own-forge-client-id
export FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-own-forge-client-secret
export FORGE_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:8080/api/auth/callback
dotnet run
```

You should now be able to explore the new endpoints tha will eventually be used from
the UI. For example, if you go to [http://localhost:8080/api/hubs](http://localhost:8080/api/hubs),
the server should respond with a JSON list of all the hubs you have access to. Try copying the ID of
one of the hubs, and use it in another address: http://localhost:8080/api/hubs/your-hub-id/projects.
In this case the server application should respond with a JSON list of all projects
available under the specified hub.
