Now that we have a basic ASP.NET application setup, let's try it out. In the command line,
setup the required environment variables, `FORGE_CLIENT_ID`, `FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and
`FORGE_CALLBACK_URL`, and run the application:

```bash
export FORGE_CLIENT_ID=your-own-forge-client-id
export FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-own-forge-client-secret
export FORGE_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:8080/api/auth/callback
dotnet run
```

When you navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser,
you should get a 404 response because we haven't implemented any server logic yet.
That's going to be the goal of the next step.
