Let's see if our new server endpoint works. Try setting the `FORGE_CLIENT_ID` and `FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET`
environment variables to your own Forge app credentials, and set the `FORGE_CALLBACK_URL` env.
variable to `http://localhost:8080/api/auth/callback` because that's where we implemented our
code handling the callbacks from Forge:

```bash
export FORGE_CLIENT_ID=your-own-forge-client-id
export FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-own-forge-client-secret
export FORGE_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:8080/api/auth/callback
dotnet run
```

:::caution
The callback URL we specify here must match the callback URL that you've configured
for your Forge application on https://forge.autodesk.com/myapps.
:::

When you navigate to [http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login](http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login)
in the browser, you should be redirected to Autodesk login page, and after logging in, you should
be redirected back to your application, for now simply returning 404. This is expected as we haven't
implemented the `GET /` endpoint yet. However, if you try and explore the cookies stored
by your browser for the `localhost` origin, you'll notice that the application is already storing
the authentication data.
