And that's it! Your application is now ready for action. Start it from the command line as usual:

```bash
export FORGE_CLIENT_ID=your-own-forge-client-id
export FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-own-forge-client-secret
export FORGE_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:8080/api/auth/callback
dotnet run
```

And then navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.
You should be presented with a simple UI, with a tree-view on the left side, and an empty viewer on the right.
Try browsing through the tree, and select a specific version of one of your files. After that the corresponding
model should be loaded into the viewer.
