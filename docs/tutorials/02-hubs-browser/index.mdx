# Hubs Browser

## Introduction

In this tutorial we're going to build a Forge application that will let us
browse through our designs in 3rd party applications built on top of the platform
such as BIM 360 Docs or Autodesk Docs.

<ResponsiveVideo src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w93ztiFO_8w" />

We will use the following components of the platform:

- [Authentication](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/developers_guide/overview)
- [Data Management](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/developers_guide/overview)
- [Viewer](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/developers_guide/overview)
