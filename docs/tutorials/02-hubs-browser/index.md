# Hubs Browser

## Introduction

In this tutorial we're going to build a Forge application that will let us
browse through our designs in 3rd party applications built on top of the platform
such as BIM 360 Docs or ACC.

![Preview](./preview.gif)

We will use the following components of the platform:

- [Authentication service](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/developers_guide/overview)
- [Data Management service](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/developers_guide/overview)
- [Forge Viewer](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/developers_guide/overview)
