# Getting Started

Here's a couple of things you want to do before building your first Forge application.

## Create an account

If you don't have a Forge account yet, sign up for one on https://forge.autodesk.com.
You can take advantage of a trial subscription that is valid for 3 months.

## Create app credentials

Create a new Forge application under https://forge.autodesk.com/myapps, and store
the _Client ID_ and _Client Secret_ credentials as we will need them later.

## Setup your environment

Some of the tutorials on this website are provided for various combinations
of programming languages and IDEs. Based on your preference, setup one of the
following development environments on your machine:

- [Node.js & VSCode](./setup/nodejs-vscode) for cross-platform development using Node.js,
- [.NET 6 & VSCode](./setup/dotnet-vscode) for cross-platform development using .NET 6, or
- [.NET 6 & VS2022](./setup/dotnet-vs2022) for development with .NET 6 and Visual Studio on Windows

And you're all set! Now head over to one of the tutorials with the programming language
and IDE of your choice.
