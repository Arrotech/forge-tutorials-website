For the coding itself you're welcome to use whichever editor you like the most.
If you're looking for recommendations, we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
as it is free, cross-platform, fast, and packed with lots of great features.
Simply install the latest stable build for your platform.

:::tip
We've also built an extension for Visual Studio Code that gives you access to
some of the Forge services and data directly from the editor, without writing
a single line of code:
[vscode-forge-tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=petrbroz.vscode-forge-tools).
