# Getting Started

Here's a couple of things you want to do before building your first Forge application.

## Create an account

If you don't have a Forge account yet, sign up for one on https://forge.autodesk.com.
You can take advantage of a trial subscription that is valid for 3 months.

## Create app credentials

In order to authenticate ourselves to the Forge platform, we will need to generate
_app credentials_ (specifically, a _client ID_ and _client secret_) for our application.

After logging into the Forge developer portal, go to _My Apps_:

![My Apps](./_shared/my-apps.png)

And click on the _Create App_ button:

Now, let's fill out the basic information about our application. The _App name_,
_App description_, and _Callback URL_ fields are all required, the rest is optional.

:::caution
Pay close attention to the _Callback URL_ field. This is the address your application's
users will be redirected to after logging in with their Autodesk credentials. It can be
any arbitrary URL but it has to match exactly the URL your server application expects.
In our tutorials we will always use the same address: `http://localhost:8080/api/auth/callback`.

Finally, enable the APIs you want your application to have access to. Unless you have
any specific reason for limiting your application's access to the different services,
enable everything.

And that's it. Now let's just store your _client ID_ and _client secret_ credentials as
we will need those **very** soon!
