# Getting Started

Here's a couple of things you want to do before building your first Forge application.

## Create an account

If you don't have a Forge account yet, sign up for one on https://forge.autodesk.com.
You can take advantage of a trial subscription that is valid for 3 months.

## Create app credentials

Create a new Forge application under https://forge.autodesk.com/myapps, and store
the _Client ID_ and _Client Secret_ credentials as we will need them later.
